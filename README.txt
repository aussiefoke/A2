Purpose

This repository was developed and debugged with limited and transparent use of a generative AI assistant. The AI was used strictly as a productivity aid for debugging, refactoring hints, and documentation phrasing. All design decisions, code changes, and verification were performed and are owned by me.

Where AI Helped (Scope)
Refactoring suggestions
Improving readability and cohesion (extracting helper methods, renaming, reducing duplication) without changing public behavior.
Project layout & Git hygiene
Advice for removing nested projects, excluding build directories, adding .gitignore, and preventing duplicate classes from old packages.
Documentation
Editing/rewriting this disclosure and the refactor log in clear English.
Not used for: solving the assignment end-to-end, writing entire features from scratch, or bypassing my understanding of the codebase. Suggestions were always reviewed, adapted, and validated by me.

Tools & Data Handling
